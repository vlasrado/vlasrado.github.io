# I slipped up again...

I am started writing this blog so that I could get some accountabilty but I didn't tell the world because I was scared of real accountabilty. I keep taking one step ahead and two steps backward. Also I don't know my goal. I don't know what is at the end of this process. What is the ideal condition? What should be my north star? I find it hard to maintain my progress since I am not working towards something. I feel complacent. I don't have any crazy dreams. I hope I find my goal soon.

## The good.

I wanted to learn the concepts in Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) a core concept that is used in self driving cars. Mainly because I was working on it when I left Phi Robotics. I finally got around to doing it. I finished it. Here is the final code. https://github.com/lasradoVinod/BreezySlam.

I did make a couple of videos on guitar and posted it on IGTV. Here's the Instagram ({{ "https://www.instagram.com/sticking.to.it.vinod"}})

## The bad.

I did not make any of my initial goals a reality. I did make my bed for a couple of weeks and but that habit didn't stick.

## Plans for this week:

### Habit of the week: Waking and sleeping on time.

I will post a video a week, regardless of how bad it is. Fingers crossed on the week ahead.
Going to work on a website for my cousin.
