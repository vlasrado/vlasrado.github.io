So I have been thinking about what to do with this blog and the steps I need to do to achieve my goals mentioned in the [previous blog] (http://vinodlasrado.me/posts/Goals/). And I have decided to follow the miracle morning.

Hal Elrod is an American author and has an awesome life story. He got into a horrific accident where he broke almost everything and recovered, ran an ultra marathon. Wrote a book only to have all his money stolen and he then self-published his book the miracle morning. While the book does a great job inspiring, I think everything in the book mainly builds up to the S.A.V.E.R.S. routine which you can see [here] (https://lifehacker.com/start-your-day-off-right-with-the-savers-morning-routin-1716241117)

Now what I am going to do with my blog. I donâ€™t have a happening life. I am a lazy bored software engineer, who wants to improve my life. So I was thinking to do three things.

Tell you about the experiments I am doing to improve myself, for example, I will be following the miracle morning routine for at least 30 days and tell you what becomes of it. Hopefully, the pressure of having to report it to you guys helps me. I will also share with you 

Secondly, to learn more, I will read and review inventions, papers, and anything tech-related. Or review books that I read, both fiction and non-fiction. This will be in another section of the blog.

I am a fickle-minded person so I keep dabbling with stuff, I will devote another section of the blog with top of my mind which explains the stuff I am dabbling with currently. 

I will also have a section that will point to youtube videos which will have some guitar covers. 
Still working on that...
