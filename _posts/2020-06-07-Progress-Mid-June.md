# I slipped up...

I started to do the S.A.V.E.R.S routine two weeks back but I am back to the path of least resistance. I will try to get back to my morning routine mentioned in my  [previous blog]({{ "/posts/About-the-blog" | relative_url }}) again this week.

## The good.

I did read a book and a half. "Behind closed doors" by B.A Paris is a great thriller and a good read. The second book that I am currently reading "Girl on the Train." This one is not as great.

I am learning a lot more of the guitar. My friend Akshaya plays the piano/keyboard so she is helping me a bit. 

## The bad.
Execise, meditation and prayer, writing is inconsistent. Need to improve on it.

## The ugly.

I got back into old habits that I had kicked out. Spending hours on Youtube, watching movies and a few others. This is scary because it took a lot of time to get out of it. 

## Plans for this week:

### Habit of the week: Making my bed.

Hopefully I get back on schedule this week. I will post a video on IGTV or youtube this week of me playing the guitar. I should do a video a week, regardless of how bad it is. Fingers crossed on the week ahead.
